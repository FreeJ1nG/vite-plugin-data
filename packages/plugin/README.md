# Vite Plugin Data

This plugin resolves the exports of data loader files at build-time and replaces the original file source with the pre-resolved exports.

A "data loader" file is a source file that has one of the following extensions:

- `.data.js`
- `.data.cjs`
- `.data.mjs`
- `.data.ts`
- `.data.cts`
- `.data.mts`

## Getting Started

Install the plugin.

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-data
```

Add the plugin to your Vite configuration.

```ts
import data from 'vite-plugin-data';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    data(),
  ],
});
```

Create a data loader with exports that should be resolved at build-time.

Example: `timestamp.data.ts`

```ts
export const timestamp = Date.now();
```

The bundled content from this file will be equivalent to the following, where the actual timestamp value was the result of `Date.now()` at build-time.

```ts
export const timestamp = 1634160000000;
```

Import the the data loader just like any other source file. No special handling is required for Typescript, because the export types are the same.

```ts
import { timestamp } from './timestamp.data.js';

console.log(timestamp);
```

## Adding Watch Patterns

Sometimes your data files may depend on other files. If those other file dependencies change, the data file should be considered changed for the purposes of HMR. You can provide watch patterns (globs) using a configuration comment in the data file. All paths must use forward slashes. Relative paths are relative to the data file containing the comment.

```ts
/* vite-plugin-data {
  watch: ["./*.json"]
} */
```

The JSON object which follows the `vite-plugin-data` comment keyword is parsed as [relaxed JSON (RJSON)](https://www.relaxedjson.org/). The most important differences are that simple keys and values do not need to be quoted, and single (`'`) or backtick (`` ` ``) quotes can be used in place of double quotes (`"`) when necessary.

> NOTE: data loader dependencies (imports) are not automatically watched. You must configure them explicitly.

## Limitations

The resolved exports must be JSON-serializable. This plugin will raise an error if the exports contain any non-JSON-serializable values, including class instances.
